OBShapedButton
==============

OBShapedButton is a UIButton subclass optimized for non-rectangular button shapes.
Instances of OBShapedButton respond to touches only in areas where the image that is
assigned to the button for UIControlStateNormal is non-transparent.

 
How to Install
--------------

### Installation via CocoaPods

If possible, you should install `OBShapedButton` via [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org):

    $ edit Podfile
    platform :ios
    pod 'OBShapedButton'

### Manual Installation

If you cannot use CocoaPods for whatever reason, manually add OBShapedButton.h, OBShapedButton.m, UIImage+ColorAtPixel.h, and UIImage+ColorAtPixel.m to your Xcode project.


Usage
-----

* Design your UI in Interface Builder with UIButtons as usual. Set the Button type to Custom
  and provide transparent PNG images for the different control states as needed.
* In the Identity Inspector in Interface Builder, set the Class of the button to `OBShapedButton`.
  That's it! Your button will now only respond to touches where the PNG image for the normal
  control state is non-transparent.
